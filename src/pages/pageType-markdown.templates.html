  <h1>Our Goal</h1>
  <p>Bike4Beds is a nonprofit organization that hosts a Fall and Spring bike event every year to raise funds for the
    current years cause. Our first event was in 2008. Matt Ritz, founder of Bike4Beds, had the idea to organize a bike
    ride for charity when he learned of the deteriorated conditions of the equipment at the Maluti Hospital, particularly
    of the patients’ beds. Akoua Enow was in her second year raising AIDS awareness with the Peace Corps. and communicated
    the need for assistance at the Hospital. Our first bike ride through New Jersey was successful and we purchased 42
    beds for the hospital and its patients! The ‘Bike4Beds’ name stuck and membership grew each year as event popularity
    spread. Bike4Beds was granted Federal Non-Profit status on March 1, 2011. In our 6 years we have donated over $20,000
    dollars to our beneficiaries. We continue to update our events with new routes and options, in order to engage more
    bikers and encourage new membership.</p>
  <p>In 2009 we donated supplies to the Dispensaire de Hiheatrowe. We were made aware of the need for assistance from a
    close family member, Kossiwa Lonergan. Kossiwa had first hand exposure to the dispensaire and its’ current condition
    while visiting her home country of Togo in 2009. In 2010 we began our four year running sponsorship of the Cavaillon
    Orphanage, run by the Sisters of Charity of Saint-Hyacinthe. Maguey O’Connor, a good family friend, suggested this
    beneficiary from her experience growing up in Haiti. The Cavaillon Orphange relies solely on donations to support
    their 25 students. Donating to this organization for four years in a row allows our bikers, sponsors and volunteers
    to feel focused in their efforts to make the world a better place, one community at a time.</p>
  <p>Bike4Beds recently brought on a team of chief officers, tasked with taking our organization to the next level. We are
    working towards expanding our options and events, gaining new membership and ultimately expanding our scope of
    support. Get ready for exciting new changes coming soon!</p>
